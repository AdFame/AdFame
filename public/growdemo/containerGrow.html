<P>Startups should give up equity for only one of two reasons: work or cash.<br><br>
Startup employees and advisors work in exchange for equity (and salary) and 
they can be fired if they don’t perform, shutting down their vesting. I’m an 
advocate of bringing on advisors with defined deliverables, earning somewhere 
around 100 basis points or less unless they’re working part-time at the company 
or insanely valuable. Investors provide the cash that help startups grow and 
receive equity in exchange for their risk capital.</P>

<P>Recently, I’ve noticed a third reason for startups giving up equity: an 
exchange for “services.” This growing trend for “accelerators” and their ilk to 
take equity in companies without providing any capital is alarming. (These 
services are not comparable to those provided by proven service providers like 
law firms that defer or reduce billings in exchange for equity—that is 
essentially the same as cash.)</P>
<P>I’ve been seeing more and more startups with an admission or expiring “term 
sheet” from these organizations, looking to us at Rock Health to simultaneously 
fund them. We understand the initial attraction to some of these 
organizations—it’s a platform to launch your company, flush with name-brand 
industry partners and networking events.</P>
<P>You want to believe that eventually the capital will follow.</P>
<P>This practice, of taking equity solely in exchange for “services” is great 
for the organization that ends up with the equity. When you don’t have to expend 
any capital, it’s easy to flood the ecosystem with features instead of products 
and hobbies instead of companies.</P>

<P>But the trend on the other side of this is disturbing—the market isn’t a fan. 
Lisa Suennen noted it in her <A href="http://www.chcf.org/~/media/MEDIA%20LIBRARY%20Files/PDF/S/PDF%20SurvivalFittestAccelerators.pdf" 
target="_blank">recent report on digital health accelerators</A>, quoting a 
healthcare industry sponsor:</P>
<P><I>“The accelerators have too much overlap and too many companies vying to 
create too many redundant ideas. They are pumping up these companies with 
unrealistic expectations about their odds of success and their ability to be 
transformative, and it is a disservice to the whole industry when the funnel 
gets overloaded; it is dilutive of talent and bandwidth and capital.”</I></P>
<P><B>Let me be clear: this model will fail to create large scale, 
venture-backable companies that transform the industry. </B>I question why 
entrepreneurs would willingly give up equity in their company—up to 10%—in 
exchange for ambiguous services. This is equity that should be going to 
employees and exceptional advisors.</P>
<P>Any well-reputed early stage investor <I>could</I> convince an entrepreneur 
to give them equity in exchange for their promised support, with no capital 
attached. But they don’t, because the practice is predatory and frankly, would 
result in selection bias.</P>
<P>Investing nothing for equity <B>turns entrepreneurs into lottery tickets and 
makes the goal to collect as many as possible. </B>Investing cash for equity 
forces organizations (like Rock Health and other funds) to make hard decisions 
on capital allocations. This isn’t a good thing for entrepreneurs, or our 
sector, and I encourage you to reject this concept before it seems like a 
norm.</P>


<p>The first settlements above 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) appeared about 3,600 years ago, and show evidence of hardier grains: mostly barley, plus some wheat and broomcorn millet, said the study, which was published in the journal Science.</p>

<p>“As barley is frost hardy and cold-tolerant, it is growing very well on the Tibetan Plateau even today,” Fahu Chen, an archaeologist at Lanzhou University in China and the lead author of the study, wrote in an email. “Barley agriculture could provide people with enough sustained food supplies even during wintertime.” The grain was introduced to the area “around 4,000 years ago alongside with wheat and sheep.”</p>

<p>Though early settlers probably made their way up the plateau in pursuit of prey as long as 20,000 years ago, more recent ones were more likely driven there by cold weather, Dr. Chen said, adding that as the temperature drops, “people need to move to a new uninhabited region or improve technology to get enough food resources.”</p>
    <p>Archaeologists collected stone artifacts and charred plant remains from 53 sites across the northeastern plateau to learn how humans came to live at high altitudes. Their findings showed that people established year-round settlements as high as 2,500 meters above sea level (about 8,200 feet) starting around 5,200 years ago. But the settlers subsisted largely on frost-sensitive grains that would not have thrived at higher altitudes.</p>
