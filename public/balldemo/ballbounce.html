with </SPAN><A href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/" target="_blank">Internet 
memes</A><SPAN>, ideas don't spread because they are good—they spread because 
they are good at spreading. One of the most virulent ideas in Internet 
regulation in recent years has been the idea that if a social problem manifests 
on the Web, the best thing that you can do to address that problem is to censor 
the Web.</SPAN></P>  <div id="famous-container" style=

<P data-textannotation-id="44e832391ec917ff0aa7cfb85c92e212">It's an attractive 
idea because if you don't think too hard, it appears to be a political 
no-brainer. It allows governments to avoid addressing the underlying social 
problem—a long and costly process—and instead simply pass the buck to Internet 
providers, who can quickly make whatever content has raised rankles "go away." 
Problem solved! Except, of course, that it isn't.</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="191ca240982b8fd9a5f3cf9c42daa226">Amongst the 
difficult social problems that Web censorship is often expected to solve are 
terrorism, child abuse and copyright and trade mark infringement. In recent 
weeks some further cases of this tactic being vainly employed against such 
problems have emerged from the United Kingdom, France and Australia.</P>

ISPs to Block Websites for Trade Mark Infringement</H3>
<P data-textannotation-id="f92ca6e0783f6fadd8d39702ee8e597b">In a victory for 
luxury brands and a loss for Internet users, the British High Court <A href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2003/3354.html" 
target="_blank">last month ordered</A> five of the country's largest ISPs to 
block websites selling fake counterfeit goods. Whilst alarming enough, this was 
merely a test case, leading the way for <A href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/internet-service-providers-fake-goods-high-court-rules" 
target="_blank">a reporte</A><A href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/internet-service-providers-fake-goods-high-court-rules" 
target="_blank">d 290,000</A>websites to be potentially targeted in future legal 
proceedings.</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="baffb775781b46a7cdbad94a34bee336">Do we imagine for a 
moment that, out of a quarter-million websites, none of them are false positives 
that actually sell non-infringing products? (If websites blocked for <A href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca" 
target="_blank">copyright infringement</A> or <A href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/there-are-lots-legit-reasons-research-pornography-new-restrictions-nih-grants-are" 
target="_blank">pornography</A> are any example, we know the answer.) Do we 
consider it a wise investment to tie up the justice system in blocking websites 
that could very easily be moved under a different domain within minutes?</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="ec5566df8fd6b93a138875799a112d9b">The reason this 
ruling concerns us is not that we support counterfeiting of manufactured goods. 
It concerns us because it further normalizes the band-aid solution of content 
blocking, and deemphasises more permanent and effective solutions that would 
target those who actually produce the counterfeit or illegal products being 
promoted on the Web.</P>

Call on ISPs to Censor Extremist Content</H3>
<P data-textannotation-id="46ff0ae5adafd4137f53b137425937df">Not content with 
enlisting major British ISPs as copyright and trade mark police, they have also 
recently been called upon to <A href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/14/isps-filter-extremist-material-internet" 
target="_blank">block extremist content on the Web</A>, and to provide a button 
that users can use to report supposed extremist material. Usual suspects <A 
href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-k-seeks-help-from-tech-firms-in-combating-extremists-online-1414010650" 
target="_blank">Google, Facebook and Twitter</A> have also been roped by the 
government to carry out blocking of their own. Yet to date no details have been 
released about how these extrajudicial blocking procedures would work, or under 
what safeguards of transparency and accountability, if any, they would 
operate.</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="e5f2f1e184591a241742b1b6a7da1cbb">This fixation on 
solving terrorism by blocking websites is not limited to the United Kingdom. 
Across the channel in France, a <A href="http://www.senat.fr/leg/pjl14-010.html" 
target="_blank">new "anti-terrorism" law</A> that EFF <A href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/proposed-anti-terror-law-france-would-erode-civil-liberties" 
target="_blank">reported on earlier</A> was finally passed this month. The law 
allows websites to be blocked if they "condone terrorism." "Terrorism" is as 
slippery a concept in France as anywhere else. Indeed France's broad definition 
of a terrorist act has <A href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/07/01/preempting-justice" 
target="_blank">drawn criticism</A> from Human Rights Watch for its legal 
imprecision.</P>
<H3 data-textannotation-id="e7a2fed0ac9ac48e61a7513670b2c07e">Australian Plans 
to Block Copyright Infringing Sites</H3>
<P data-textannotation-id="5040eebae6958a4a0bdab05f4ccbad11">Finally—though, 
sadly, probably not—reports last week suggest that <A href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/online-piracy-websites-set-to-be-blocked-sources-20141117-11o8pz.html" 
target="_blank">Australia will be next</A> to follow the <A href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17894176" 
target="_blank">example of the UK</A> and <A href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/spanish-copyright-amendments-will-shakedown-news-sites-and-censor-web" 
target="_blank">Spain</A> in blocking websites that host or link to allegedly 
copyright material, following on from a <A href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/australia-you-wouldnt-steal-dvd-you-would-block-websites-and-suspend-internet" 
target="_blank">July discussion paper</A> that mooted this as a possible measure 
to combat copyright infringement.</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="21a497461aadcd9f683283bac48075fc">How did this become 
the new normal? When did politicians around the world lose the will to tackle 
social problems head-on, and instead decide to sweep them under the rug by 
blocking evidence of them from the Web? It certainly isn't due to any evidence 
that these policies actually <EM>work</EM>. Anyone who wants to access blocked 
content can trivially do so, using software like <A href="https://www.torproject.org/" 
target="_blank">Tor</A>.</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="e9f5ded6cf267fc2feeb9ff9485d8bb5">Rather, it seems to 
be that it's politically better for governments to be seen as doing something to 
address such problems, no matter how token and ineffectual, than to do 
nothing—and website blocking is the easiest "something" they can do. But not 
only is blocking not effective, it is actively harmful—both at its point of 
application due to the risk of over-blocking, but also for the Internet as a 
whole, in the legitimization that it offers to repressive regimes to censor and 
control content online.</P>
<P data-textannotation-id="5addeaa62bb1a2461a184c4287168aa3">Like an <A href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=keep+calm+and+meme+!i" 
target="_blank">overused Internet meme that deserves to fade away</A>, so too it 
is time that courts and regulators moved on from website blocking as a cure for 
society's ills. If we wish to reduce political extremism, cut off the production 
of counterfeits, or prevent children from being abused, then we should be 
addressing those problems directly—rather than by merely covering up the 
evidence and pretending they have gone away.</P>
