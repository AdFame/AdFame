    <P>Tinkering to get <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/05/chevrolet-corvette-performance-recorder/">better 
performance</A> out of your ride is one of the more rewarding aspects of vehicle 
ownership. The thing is, as cars have become more and more computer-dependent, 
getting a horsepower boost or better gas mileage by swapping exhaust systems or 
air filters is just the beginning. Sometimes to hit the level you'd want, 
tweaking the engine control or primary control module by aftermarket means is 
necessary.</P>

<p>Thanks to the <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/26/dmca-update-makes-new-phone-unlocking-illegal/">Digital 
Millenium Copyright Act</A>, however, that puts wrenching on your vehicle into 
murky legal territory. The folks at the <A href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/11/03/eff_dmca_petitioncarmodification_dkt._2014-07.pdf">Electronic 
Frontier Foundation</A> (PDF) have your back and are hoping to keep the DMCA out 
from under your hood, though. <A href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/11/25/will-copyright-law-stop-you-from-working-on-your-car-in-the-near/">As 
<EM>Autoblog</EM> notes</A>, the EFF is hoping its petition to the federal 
copyright office will result in removing some of the legal issues that can arise 
from futzing with your car's electronic brain-box.</P>
<DIV><SPAN>The argument is that this would put ownership back in the hands of, 
well, the vehicle owners. It'd give them the freedom to mod their car as they 
see fit instead of an OEM locking performance to its own parameters. This would 
also have an impact on the repair industry. While an independent garage or body 
shop has access to basically anything needed to fix your car, there are a few 
specific operations that can only be done by, say, a Ford or Chevy dealership 
due to the needed proprietary tools; this could expand in scope. 
</SPAN><SPAN>Autoblog's sources</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>argue that in this 
case, the DMCA could be used to extend a monopoly (as has apparently been done 
in other industries) and eliminate the customer's right to choose where they can 
have their vehicle fixed. </SPAN></DIV>
<P><SPAN>Yes, there's a lot going on here, but there's precedent that the courts 
aren't exactly keen on letting the DMCA intrude on consumer rights. In 2005, the 
US Court of Appeals <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/02/22/judge-gives-cheap-ink-catridges-a-pass-a-setback-to-lexmark/">ruled 
against Lexmark</A> when it tried invoking the DMCA to keep third parties from 
manufacturing cheap print cartridges for its printers. Hopefully something 
similar can happen here as well. </SPAN></P>
