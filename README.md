AdFame
======
### Introduction
AdFame is an interactive mobile advertising platform that utilizes natural 
gestures and animations to seamlessly inlay ads into any website.

### The Problem
There are two primary problems with online advertising as it exists today. 
The first is on the consumer side: ads are annoying. They disrupt the flow 
of content and disrupt user experience. The second is an analytics problem: 
current data is inaccurate. Accidental clicks are not accounted for in 
measuring ad effectiveness, and measuring dislike is based on passive data.

### The Solution
AdFame makes ads more elegant by transitioning them onto and off of the 
screen using natural gestures and physics based animation. We are introducing 
an innovative swipe system to remove unwanted ads from the screen or route 
users to a target web page, all while collecting valuable analytics data. By 
actively engaging the user we no longer rely solely on passive data to 
measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign.
